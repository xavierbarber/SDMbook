# Preferential Sampling in the context of SDM  (David)

Y aquí ya empezamos con nuestra investigación. Lo primero que vamos a mostrar es el preferencial, ya que en la gran mayoría de an´lsiis espacial que se haga en ecología este tipo de enfoque seguro que tiene cabida.


## Unraveling the Intricacies of Preferential Sampling in Species Distribution Models 


When it comes to modeling species distributions, one might assume that the data at hand is random and unbiased. However, this is often not the case. Many a time, the locations of sampled data are not independent of the underlying process we wish to study. This phenomenon, where sampling locations are influenced by the very process of interest, is termed 'preferential sampling'. And in the world of Species Distribution Models (SDMs), it poses both challenges and opportunities.

In this chapter, "Preferential Sampling in the context of SDM", we will delve deep into the complexities arising from non-random sampling patterns and their implications for modeling species distributions using R-INLA. Acknowledging and addressing preferential sampling is crucial, as neglecting it can lead to biased inferences, potentially misguiding conservation efforts, policy decisions, or scientific understanding.

But why R-INLA? The framework's advanced capabilities for Bayesian inference, combined with its adeptness in handling intricate spatial structures, make it an invaluable tool for tackling the challenges posed by preferential sampling. Through R-INLA, we can incorporate the potential dependence between the sampling locations and the underlying spatial process, leading to more accurate and robust SDMs.

Armed with real-world examples, hands-on coding exercises, and vivid visual illustrations, we aim to provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of preferential sampling and its nuances. By the end of this chapter, you will have gained both the theoretical knowledge and practical skills to recognize, assess, and account for preferential sampling in your species distribution modeling endeavors.

So, let us embark on this journey to understand the subtle dance between where we sample and what we discover, ensuring that our SDMs truly reflect the intricate tapestry of life on Earth.
