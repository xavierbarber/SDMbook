# Spatial Data  (data type and Maps) (Virgilio)

De nuevo VIrgilio nos deleitará con su saber sobre estadística espacial y enseñará el camino a los lectores, pero sin entrar en analizar datos, un capítulo  con los conocimientos necesarios en \R para poder plotear mapas chulos, que paquetes usar, como cargar un mapa que viene de GIS, etc... Todo lo que un *practicioner* debe saber antes de enfrentarse a datos espaciales como tal. ¿Cómo lo ves Virgilio?

##  Mapping the Confluence of Spatial Data and Species Distributions 


The canvas on which species paint their intricate patterns of distribution is inherently spatial. As we attempt to model these patterns, understanding the character and nuances of spatial data becomes imperative. It is the matrix of coordinates, polygons, and raster cells that gives life to the ecological narratives of species existence and abundance.

In this chapter, "Spatial Data (data type and Maps)", we embark on a journey to explore the multifaceted world of spatial data within the context of Species Distribution Models (SDMs) using R-INLA. From vector data delineating precise locations to raster data capturing continuous environmental gradients, each data type offers unique insights into species-habitat relationships. Beyond mere data types, the realm of spatial data also encompasses the visual wonders of maps, transforming abstract numbers into tangible representations that reveal underlying ecological stories.

R-INLA, with its cutting-edge capabilities for Bayesian inference, holds particular promise for spatial modeling. Its prowess in handling complex spatial structures ensures that our SDMs are not only statistically robust but also ecologically meaningful. As we delve into R-INLA's tools for spatial data analysis, we'll uncover techniques to seamlessly integrate data types, craft intricate maps, and ultimately harness the full potential of spatial information in our models.

Guided by practical examples, code snippets, and vivid visualizations, this chapter seeks to be both a primer for the uninitiated and a deep dive for the experienced, bridging the gap between spatial data intricacies and the powerful modeling framework of R-INLA.

Join us as we traverse this spatial dimension, illuminating the path to more informed, accurate, and insightful species distribution models.
