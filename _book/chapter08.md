# Barriers and non-stationarity models (David y Joaquin)

Y ya que David y Joaquín habrán cogido ritmo por el capítulo 6 y 7, pues aunarán esfuerzos para crear el capítulo de las Barreras.



## Beyond Uniformity – Embracing Barriers and Non-Stationarity in SDMs 

In the vast landscapes that species inhabit, uniformity is often more the exception than the rule. The natural world is replete with barriers – be they mountain ranges, rivers, or anthropogenic constructions – that can impede or redirect species movements and distributions. Coupled with this is the concept of non-stationarity, where the relationships between species and their environment aren't consistent across space, reflecting the ever-changing tapestry of ecological interactions.

The chapter "Barriers and non-stationarity models" is dedicated to untangling these complexities in the context of Species Distribution Models (SDMs). While traditional models often operate under the assumption of spatial stationarity, real-world scenarios frequently challenge these assumptions. It becomes essential, then, to adapt and evolve our modeling techniques to more faithfully represent the intricate dance of species across heterogeneous landscapes.

R-INLA, with its refined capabilities for Bayesian spatial modeling, offers a promising avenue for addressing these challenges. Through its flexible framework, we can incorporate barriers directly into our models, ensuring they influence species distributions in a biologically meaningful manner. Likewise, R-INLA's adeptness at handling non-stationary relationships ensures that our models remain sensitive to the varying dynamics between species and their environment across different spatial scales.

In this chapter, theory meets practice. Supported by empirical examples, hands-on exercises, and vivid illustrations, we will guide readers through the nuances of modeling barriers and non-stationarity using R-INLA. By journey's end, you'll be equipped with a richer understanding and a robust toolkit to capture the multifaceted realities of species distributions in our ever-diverse world.

Let us embark on this exploration, where barriers become more than just obstacles, and where changing spatial dynamics are not challenges but opportunities to deepen our ecological insights.
