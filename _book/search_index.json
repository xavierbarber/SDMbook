(Xavi, Antonio y artistas invitados) Pues la verdad es que no sé aquí que pondremos… supongo que las “open questions”… a ver que tal sale … o si llegamos desfondados a este capítulo. 14.1 Navigating the Multifaceted Landscape of Advanced SDMs The journey of understanding species distributions is rife with complexities, not merely in the ecological phenomena they depict, but in the analytical intricacies we encounter. Beyond the foundational principles and standard methodologies, a plethora of nuanced issues await the discerning modeler – challenges that, when addressed, can significantly elevate the depth, accuracy, and utility of Species Distribution Models (SDMs). In this chapter, Other Issues (downscaling, spatial confounding, multiple likelihoods, big data and mapping the world), we step off the beaten path to explore these often-underappreciated yet crucial facets of SDM. Each of these issues, whether it’s the art of downscaling, the challenge of spatial confounding, the intricacies of handling multiple likelihoods, the enormity of big data, or the ambitious endeavor of mapping the world, represents a unique puzzle demanding tailored solutions. Harnessing the unparalleled capabilities of R-INLA and INLABRU, we embark on this intricate journey. These powerful tools, with their adaptability and depth, are primed to tackle these challenges head-on, turning potential roadblocks into opportunities for enriched insights. Guided by a blend of theory, practical exercises, and illustrative examples, we will: Delve into the subtleties of downscaling, understanding its necessity and methodologies in the context of SDMs. Unravel the complexities of spatial confounding, ensuring our models remain robust and ecologically meaningful. Explore the world of multiple likelihoods, optimizing our models for diverse data sources and ecological realities. Grapple with big data, leveraging its vastness without drowning in its depth. And, with ambition in our hearts, explore the potential and challenges of mapping the world, providing holistic, global insights into species distributions. Beyond the techniques and tools, we’ll keep an ever-watchful eye on the ecological and conservation implications of our endeavors, ensuring our models remain grounded in their ultimate purpose – understanding, preserving, and coexisting with the myriad species that share our planet. Embark with us on this advanced expedition through the multi-dimensional world of SDMs, harnessing the combined prowess of R-INLA and INLABRU to navigate and illuminate these intricate terrains.
