# Joint Species Distribution  models  (Xavi)

Pues me ha tocado a mi, como era lógico, escribir el capítulo de modelizar Varias Espcies a la vez. A ver si conseguimos que el famoso $\alpha_{2|1}$ nos sale bien y utilizamos lo que nunca hemos llegado a publicar de este tema.


##  Synergy in Nature - Delving into Joint Species Distribution Models

Ecological landscapes are a symphony of interactions, where the presence, abundance, or absence of one species often hinges on the intricate web of relations with others. Species do not exist in isolation; they are part of a larger community, governed by competition, mutualism, predation, and a myriad of other interspecies interactions. Capturing this interconnectedness is not just a matter of ecological authenticity but of model accuracy and predictive power.

Enter "Joint Species Distribution Models" (JSDMs). By moving beyond the traditional single-species modeling approach, JSDMs provide a holistic view, allowing for the simultaneous modeling of multiple species, thereby integrating the direct and indirect interactions that shape community structures and spatial patterns.

In this chapter, we unravel the complexities and opportunities associated with JSDMs. Utilizing the robust frameworks of R-INLA and INLABRU, we will dive into the methodologies that allow for the integration of multiple species data sets, shedding light on the shared environmental drivers and potential biotic interactions.

Through a blend of theoretical discussions, illustrative examples, and hands-on exercises, we aim to equip readers with the knowledge and tools to construct, interpret, and apply JSDMs. We will delve into the nuances of model specification, explore methods to disentangle species interactions from environmental effects, and address the challenges of high dimensionality and potential collinearity.

The overarching goal is to harness the power of JSDMs to provide deeper insights into community ecology, inform conservation strategies, and predict changes in biodiversity under various scenarios, all while tapping into the synergies and interdependencies that define nature.

Join us on this enlightening journey, as we navigate the multifaceted world of joint species distributions, guided by the combined capabilities of R-INLA and INLABRU.
