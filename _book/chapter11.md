# Spatio-temporal species distribution   (Iosu)

Y como Iosu ya habrá calentado con el chapter 10, entonces ahora cogerá sus papers de Spatio-Temporal y nos hará un coqueto capítulo.

## Navigating the Dynamic Tapestry of Spatio-temporal Species Distribution

The ever-shifting landscapes of our planet, influenced by a myriad of ecological and anthropogenic factors, ensure that species distributions are not static snapshots but dynamic canvases evolving over time. To capture this essence of change and spatial intricacy, spatio-temporal modeling emerges as a critical tool, allowing us to understand not just where a species might be found, but also when and how its distribution might shift.

In the chapter "Spatio-temporal Species Distribution," we embark on a journey to explore the confluence of space and time in the realm of Species Distribution Models (SDMs). Recognizing that species distributions are a product of both present conditions and historical legacies, and that they may hint at future trajectories, we dive deep into methodologies that capture these complex dynamics.

With the combined prowess of R-INLA and INLABRU, we are equipped with a powerful suite of tools to tackle the challenges of spatio-temporal modeling. These frameworks, designed with flexibility and precision in mind, allow for the integration of diverse data sources and the crafting of models that reflect the true dynamism of ecological systems.

Through theoretical discussions, real-world case studies, and hands-on tutorials, this chapter aims to guide readers through the intricacies of spatio-temporal SDMs. From understanding temporal trends and seasonality to predicting future distributions under changing scenarios, we'll explore the myriad ways in which time adds depth and dimension to our spatial models.

As we navigate the interplay of space and time, we also confront the broader implications of our findings. How can spatio-temporal models inform conservation strategies, habitat management, and ecological forecasting? These questions, and more, will be addressed as we journey through the dynamic world of spatio-temporal species distribution.

So, let us set forth on this exploration, where time becomes more than a mere backdrop, and space is understood in its ever-changing context, all through the lens of R-INLA and INLABRU.
