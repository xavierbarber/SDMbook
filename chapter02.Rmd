# Bayesian Inference: Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation & Variational Bayes. (Virgilio)

Aquí Virgilio nos marcará el camino de la notación, utilizando como base su libro Bayesian Inference nos hará una intro a la Bayesiana para que los lectores entinedan de qué va esto y que son eso de los parámetros/hiperparámetros y porque "en Bayesiano" y porque con "INLA". 

## Introduction: Navigating the Bayesian Landscape 


In the vast universe of statistical methodologies, Bayesian Inference stands as a beacon, illuminating the path toward a deeper understanding of data and the underlying processes that generate them. This probabilistic framework, named after the Reverend Thomas Bayes, offers a fundamentally different approach to understanding uncertainty compared to traditional frequentist methods.

At its core, Bayesian Inference elegantly melds prior knowledge or beliefs with observed data, resulting in updated or "posterior" beliefs about the phenomena in question. This continuous cycle of learning, updating, and refining stands in stark contrast to the rigid hypothesis testing of classical statistics. Instead of isolated point estimates, Bayesian methods provide entire distributions of probabilities, enabling richer interpretations and more nuanced decision-making.

Despite its age-old foundations, Bayesian Inference has witnessed a renaissance in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Advances in computational power and algorithms, particularly Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, have made intricate Bayesian models computationally tractable. As a result, fields ranging from genetics to economics, and from ecology to astrophysics, are increasingly turning to Bayesian methodologies to solve complex problems.

In this book, we embark on a journey through the Bayesian landscape. From foundational principles to advanced modeling techniques, we will dissect the Bayesian paradigm, aiming to provide readers with both the theoretical underpinnings and practical tools to navigate the Bayesian world confidently.

Join us as we delve into the intuitive and powerful world of Bayesian Inference, a realm where data, prior beliefs, and probability converge to shape our understanding of the world around us.
