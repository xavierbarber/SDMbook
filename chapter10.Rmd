# Presence-only (INLABRU)  (Xavi y Iosu)

Vale, aquí yo si que voyu a tener que estudiar, espero que Iosu me ayude bastante... o ese es mi deseo.

Este capítulo fue una de las cosas que nos piderieron los Revisores, y por eso lo hemos incluido

## Unraveling the Enigma of Presence-Only Data with INLABRU

In the vast repositories of ecological data, presence-only datasets stand out as both a treasure trove and a challenge. They represent locations where a species is known to occur, but without the balancing act of absence data, offering a one-sided view of the distribution landscape. While abundant and often easier to collect, the intrinsic biases and nuances of presence-only data have historically posed analytical challenges in the realm of Species Distribution Models (SDMs).

The chapter "Presence-Only with INLABRU" delves deep into this specific data type, guiding readers through its intricacies and the advanced methodologies available within the INLABRU framework for its effective utilization. INLABRU, as an extension of R-INLA, emerges as a beacon of hope in this context, providing tools specifically tailored to tackle the challenges and harness the potential of presence-only data.

Through a combination of theoretical insights, hands-on exercises, and empirical examples, we will explore how INLABRU facilitates the creation of robust and insightful SDMs from presence-only datasets. From understanding potential sampling biases to creating pseudo-absence points and integrating environmental covariates, this chapter aims to offer a comprehensive guide to modeling with presence-only data using INLABRU.

Beyond just techniques and methodologies, we will also address the ecological and conservation implications of the insights derived from such models. The goal is not only to produce accurate models but also to derive meaningful interpretations that can guide conservation and management strategies.

Embark with us on this enlightening journey through the world of presence-only data. Together, we will navigate its challenges, embrace its potential, and unlock new horizons in species distribution modeling using the combined might of R-INLA and INLABRU.
